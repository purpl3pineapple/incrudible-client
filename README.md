# incrudible-client

Shared client-side JS framework for InCRUDibly-based Apps Script apps,
built via `esbuild` and served via jsDelivr's GitHub CDN mode
(`@main`-pinned).

`APP.imageToUpload(file)` reads a browser `File` and resolves to
`{ name, mimeType, base64 }`, ready to combine with a Drive `folderId` for
`InCRUDibly.uploadImage`. It rejects non-image files and images larger than
10 MiB before starting `FileReader`.

`DAYS.daysElapsed(start, end, options)` counts signed whole days between two
strict `YYYY-MM-DD` dates. With `businessDays: true`, it excludes the start
date, includes the end date, skips weekends, and calls the optional
`isHoliday(isoDate)` predicate for caller-owned closure calendars.

```js
import { DAYS } from "incrudible-client";

const elapsed = DAYS.daysElapsed("2026-07-17", "2026-07-20", {
  businessDays: true,
  isHoliday: isoDate => bankClosures.has(isoDate),
});
// 1
```

## Architecture

`APP` remains the public compatibility facade. Its workflow, rule, UI,
feedback, and modal state is owned by pure reducers in `src/state.js`; existing
assignments such as `APP.workflow = value` and `APP.rules.modalRules = rules`
dispatch actions behind that facade.

Store subscriptions apply state to browser effects such as the loading overlay,
theme persistence, and selected tabs. Form values, rule evaluation, rendering,
clipboard and server calls, and transient interactions such as drawers and
dragging stay outside the store so DOM state is not duplicated.

## Testing

Install dependencies and the browser engines once:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

`npm test` rebuilds the production bundle, then tests that artifact in Chromium,
Firefox, and WebKit. Use `npm run test:headed -- --project=chromium` to inspect
the browser interactions locally.
